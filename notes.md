Further ideas for project:

1. remove all entries with prices = 0
2. remove entries with categories 99 and dvd (50), maybe also encyclopedias (44)

3. clustering price vs category
4. other clustering ideas on categories (?)


Big important step:
logistic model + linear model


More ideas:

1. Further EDA on categories
2. Super naive model (all response = 0)
3. Feature selection (stepwise, lasso, etc.)
4. All possible interactions
5. More features ?


For super later:
